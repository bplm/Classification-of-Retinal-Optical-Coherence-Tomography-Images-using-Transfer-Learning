# Classification-of-Retinal-Optical-Coherence-Tomography-Images-using-Transfer-Learning
This repository contains code for the Classification of Retinal Optical Coherence Tomography Images using Transfer Learning.Its written in Python and originally we have run it in Kaggle Virtual Machine

# DATASET USED
The dataset has been taken from kaggle.
https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/kermany2018
The dataset consists of three folders (train, test, val) and includes subfolders for each group of images (NORMAL,CNV,DME,DRUSEN). There are 84,495 (JPEG) X-Ray images and 4 groups of (NORMAL,CNV,DME,DRUSEN).Images are labelled as (disease)-(randomized patient ID)-(patient's image number) and divided into four directories: CNV, DME, DRUSEN, and NORMAL. Spectralis OCT (Heidelberg Engineering, Germany) photos were selected from retrospective cohorts of adult patients from the University of California San Diego Shiley Eye Institute, the California Retinal Research Foundation, the Medical Center Ophthalmology Associates, the Shanghai First People's Hospital, and the Beijing Tongren Eye Center between July 1, 2013.
